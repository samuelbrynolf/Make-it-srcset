# Make it Srcset

This is a Wordpress plugin for adding srcset attributes to images. Wordpress uses srcset by default, but I needed more control for the sizes-attribute and a settings-page to finetuning best performance.

Make it Srcset also adds a simple lightbox-solution and lazyloading-feature. All documentation is in Swedish so far :/ but that might change in the future.
